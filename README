This is the most stupidly entertaining 25-odd lines of Ruby code EVAR.

Let anyone in your office make your computer say anything. Works on a Mac, doesn't work on anything else.

Usage: `ruby talkserver.rb`

Then, anyone can go to http://[your local ip address]:8000/"This is what I want the computer to say." and it'll say it.

On line 21 you can change the voice the computer uses. You may not have the "Daniel" voice installed if you haven't downloaded the international speech pack. 

If you're feeling particularly devious, get the script running on a co-worker's machine, then hand out the URL to everyone else in the office. When you're pulled in for a talk with HR, remember: Deny, deny, deny.

PROTIP: In the URL, replace the quotes with %22 and spaces with %20 so you can post links into Skype chats!
